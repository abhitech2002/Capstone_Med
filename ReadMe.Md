## Objective of Medical Data Management and Analytics System:

Create a medical app backend with the following capabilities:
1. Data management: Create a database to keep track of patient data, physician information, and uploaded medical reports. Create   useful schemas to efficiently organize and store the data.
2. RESTful API endpoints should be created in order to manage CRUD operations for patients, physicians, and reports. Create endpoints that can be used to create, read, update, and delete entities.
3. Analyze the uploaded medical reports using deep learning or AI models to produce automated analytics. To process the reports and extract pertinent insights, implement backend logic.
4. Implement API endpoints to retrieve information about patients, doctors, and report analytics. Allow sorting and filtering options to improve user experience.
5. Data Validation: Check user input to make sure that all required fields are filled in and that it complies with any requirements, such as the data formats for medical reports or patient information.
6. Security: Adopt appropriate security measures to safeguard user data and guarantee confidentiality while adhering to pertinent laws governing the protection of patient data.
7. Provide detailed and understandable documentation for the backend API, detailing each endpoint's requirements for request payloads and expected responses.

Patients can upload and manage their medical reports using this straightforward medical app, view automated analytics, and communicate with doctors. Doctors have access to patient profiles, can look over reports, and can offer medical guidance or care. Deep learning or AI models are used in the backend to analyze reports and produce insights. Once the core functionalities are implemented, additional features like appointment scheduling, chat functionality, or notifications can be added as upgrades.

## Introduction
The Medical Data Management and Analytics System is designed to efficiently organize and store patient data, physician information, and medical reports. The system employs API methods to provide valuable insights by analyzing the uploaded medical reports.

## Features
1. Database Creation: A robust database is implemented to store patient records, physician details, and medical reports. Schemas are designed to ensure efficient data organization.

2. RESTful API Endpoints: CRUD operations for patients, physicians, and reports are supported through well-defined API endpoints. Users can easily create, read, update, and delete entities.

3. Medical Report Analytics: The system utilizes API methods to automatically process medical reports and extract essential insights. The backend logic implements the analytics processing.

4. Information Retrieval: API endpoints are provided to retrieve patient and physician information along with medical report analytics. The endpoints offer sorting and filtering options for an enhanced user experience.

5. Data Validation: User input is rigorously validated to ensure all required fields are filled

## Technologies Used
- Backend Framework: Node.js with Express
- Database:  MongoDB
- API Documentation: [Your API Documentation Tool]
- Data Validation Library: [Your Data Validation Library]
- Security: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and bcrypt for password hashing

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm.
3. Set up the database and configure the connection.
4. Start the server using node server.js.

## API Endpoints
Here are the main API endpoints provided by the system:


- **Register and Login:**
  - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /login`: Login with user credentials.

- **Patients:**
  - `GET /patients`: Get a list of all patients.
  - `GET /patients/:id`: Get details of a specific patient.
  - `POST /patients`: Create a new patient record.
  - `PUT /patients/:id`: Update an existing patient record.
  - `DELETE /patients/:id`: Delete a patient record.

- **Physicians:**
  - `GET /physicians`: Get a list of all physicians.
  - `GET /physicians/:id`: Get details of a specific physician.
  - `POST /physicians`: Add a new physician to the system.
  - `PUT /physicians/:id`: Update physician details.
  - `DELETE /physicians/:id`: Remove a physician from the system.

- **Medical Reports:**
  - `GET /reports`: Get a list of all medical reports.
  - `GET /reports/:id`: Get details of a specific medical report.
  - `POST /reports`: Upload a new medical report.
  - `PUT /reports/:id`: Update medical report details.
  - `DELETE reports/:id`: Delete a medical report.

<!-- - **Report Analytics:**
  - `GET /api/reports/:id/analytics`: Get automated analytics for a specific medical report.

## Data Validation
The system validates user input to ensure that all required fields are provided and that data conforms to specific formats for medical reports and patient information. Detailed error messages will be returned in case of validation failures. -->

## Security
We take security seriously and have implemented appropriate measures to safeguard user data. This includes encryption of sensitive information and adhering to relevant data protection laws.

## Register and Login
To use the Medical Data Management and Analytics System, users must first register with the system by providing their credentials. After successful registration, users can log in to access the API endpoints.
